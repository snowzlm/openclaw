summary: "Isolated transcript admission lifecycle investigation for issue 166446"
title: "Admission lifecycle investigation"
---

This investigation is based on upstream revision
`d9813e3489766284c105907f30065a83ff798a11`.

The added fixture resolves a synthetic persisted target through
`resolveAgentRunSessionTarget`, installs the real durable admission callback,
and persists through `createUserTurnTranscriptRecorder.persistApproved` before
awaiting the recorder persistence waiter. This proves later self-persistence identity,
not an outstanding runtime-write/provider-dispatch race. Ordinary, child, and
requester-settle-shaped keys are covered, but this is not a live Telegram,
spawn, or announcement reproduction. Logs contain only field equality booleans.

The manual-only workflow also runs the existing provider-dispatch rejection
contract. No comparison is relaxed, no rejection is caught or suppressed, and
no production repair is proposed until the incident mismatch is identified.

## Scoped diagnostic improvement

The rejecting callback now includes only `agentIdMatches`, `sessionIdMatches`,
`sessionKeyMatches`, and `storePathMatches` in the exception. Comparisons remain
strict and fail closed; the recorder waiter still rejects before dispatch.
No actual identifier, key, path, message, or admission receipt is serialized.
This is diagnostic coverage, not a repair of the reported production incident.

The expanded isolated lifecycle fixture starts with persisted history, resolves
an uppercase supplied key to the existing canonical key, installs the callback,
and holds the real database write lane while another transcript append queues.
The runtime writer reports its real appended anchor to the recorder inside the
lane. The waiter must settle detached admission behind both writes without
changing identity. This does not exercise live Telegram, spawn, or announcement
entry points and must not be labeled an incident reproduction.

Release-note context: delayed durable admission failures now identify the
mismatching identity field with privacy-safe equality booleans. Release-owned
changelogs are intentionally unchanged; this note belongs in the PR evidence.

## Composed runtime dispatch coverage

The provider suite also composes the guarded SessionManager's real runtime
message write, its recorder notification, the durable admission callback,
recorder waiter, and provider dispatch gate. Matching ownership dispatches;
deliberately differing prepared session/key/store bindings reject without a
provider call and surface the boolean error in the runtime assistant failure.
An agent mismatch is induced by mutating the retained prepared target after
preparation; otherwise conflicting physical-store ownership is rejected earlier.
This is an explicit callback mutation probe, not a reachable incident producer
or a root-cause repair. Runtime output reports only the diagnostic and zero
provider calls. The provider stream is mocked; no paid API or production Gateway
is used. An additional composed case invokes the real pre-persisted current-user-turn
preparer, adopts the actual existing anchor with `appended: false`, settles
durable admission, and dispatches without duplicating the user write.

The manual workflow explicitly fetches its immutable baseline before reading
the source blob, so later branch/main dispatches do not depend on shallow depth.

## Actual isolated runtime exploration

The optional `actual_runtime=true` dispatch builds the real OpenClaw CLI and SDK
on a GitHub-hosted runner and installs the pinned published
`@martian-engineering/lossless-claw@1.1.1` package only in temporary test state.
The isolated Gateway binds loopback on a separate free port. No operator state,
production data, channel credentials, paid provider keys, or installed Gateway
files are used. The test environment is explicit; no ambient credentials are
inherited by the runtime subprocesses. No config, transcript, or database is
uploaded.

The HTTP model endpoint is an explicitly disclosed loopback stub, not inference.
The production HTTP provider adapter, CLI/Gateway entrypoints, target producers,
manager writes and durable engine run unchanged. The script neither forges
admission receipts nor monkeypatches ownership checks. It explores fresh and
persisted history, supplied uppercase keys, a fixed store locator with distinct
agents, public parent-linked creation, public reset, and restart of the owned
test Gateway. Read-only aggregate counts in the plugin's `turn_advancements`
table distinguish actual durable advancement from a silent legacy fallback.

This lane is exploratory: successful turns show only that these actual setup
scenarios preserve ownership. They do not reproduce the incident or supply
after-fix rejection diagnostics. A setup, compatibility, or migration failure
is reported at its exact stage rather than replaced with synthetic receipt
injection. Only an organically reached rejecting callback would add real-setup
diagnostic evidence; the incident's producer still requires independent replay.
